Abstract: Generative models have been in existence for many decades. In the field of machine learning, we come across many scenarios when directly learning a target is intractable through discriminative models, and in such cases the joint distribution of the target and the training data is approximated and generated. These generative models help us better represent or model a set of data by generating data in the form of Markov chains or simply employing a generative iterative process to do the same. With the recent innovation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), it is now possible to make use of AI to generate pieces of art, music, etc. with a high extent of realism. In this paper, we review and analyse critically all the generative models, namely Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), and GANs. We study their algorithms and implement each of the models to provide the reader some insights on which generative model to pick from while dealing with a problem. We also provide some noteworthy contributions done in the past to these models from the literature.
